this is also a stacked together version no different from the base choas script. thanks to the makers of the following scripts.
-Auto Cards, Story Arc Engine, ReputeX, True Auto Stats, Random Events, Narrative guidance, System requests.
Special thanks to the maker of Dynamic Living world which i added to the barebones of the choas script. it included
- text formatter, simplified time tracker,- remapping of TAS,SAE and Autocards
As usual i just get bubblegum and stack everything together. have fun
